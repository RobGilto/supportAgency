# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Smart Support Agent Application, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on my review of the brief.md, I can see this is a greenfield project with no mention of using a starter template or existing codebase. The project is being built from scratch as a comprehensive multi-user browser-based platform.

N/A - No starter template or existing project will be used.
