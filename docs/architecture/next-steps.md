# Next Steps

After completing this architecture document:

## Immediate Actions
1. **Save Architecture Document:** This document provides the complete blueprint for the Smart Support Agent Application

2. **Begin Development:** Start implementing components using the defined architecture patterns

## Development Phase Planning
1. **Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4):**
   - Set up React + TypeScript + Vite project structure
   - Implement IndexedDB schema with Dexie
   - Create base repository pattern
   - Build basic case management CRUD

2. **Phase 2 - Content Processing (Weeks 5-8):**
   - Implement sophisticated paste tool
   - Build WebP image conversion and gallery
   - Create annotation engine with Canvas API
   - Develop pattern matching system

3. **Phase 3 - Smart Features (Weeks 9-12):**
   - Build Hivemind generation with iterative LLM workflow
   - Implement search engine with Flexsearch
   - Create analytics dashboard
   - Add CLI terminal functionality

4. **Phase 4 - Polish & Deployment (Weeks 13-16):**
   - Docker containerization
   - Manual testing execution
   - Performance optimization
   - Production deployment setup

## Technical Implementation Notes for Developers

**Critical Implementation Requirements:**
- Use exact case number format: 8-digit numbers (e.g., "05907169")
- JIRA ticket validation: "DOMO-456837" and "HIVE-2263" patterns
- WebP conversion for all images before IndexedDB storage
- Result<T, E> pattern for all error-prone operations
- Repository pattern for all database access
- 500-line maximum file size limit

**Key Integration Points:**
- Domo LLM manual workflow with structured prompts
- Salesforce case number field integration
- JIRA URL generation for tickets
- Image gallery with annotation capabilities

This architecture provides a complete blueprint for building the Smart Support Agent Application as a local-first browser application with sophisticated support management capabilities.
